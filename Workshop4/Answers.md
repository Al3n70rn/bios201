:question: What is the most common fragment length?

:question: What does the peak at around 200 bp likely represent?

:question: What is the max coverage for each sample in the chr4:105,079,645-105,815,457 window?

:question: Try adding the insertion track as well -- how does it compare to the coverage track for the same sample?

Insertion track is much less smooth! Shows per base insertion points at base pair resolution rather than fragment coverage in 100 bp windows.
