:question: What is the most common fragment length?

:question: What does the peak at around 200 bp likely represent?

:question: What is the max coverage for each sample in the chr4:105,079,645-105,815,457 window?

:question: Try adding the insertion track as well -- how does it compare to the coverage track for the same sample?

Insertion track is much less smooth! Shows per base insertion points at base pair resolution rather than fragment coverage in 100 bp windows.

:question: What is the approximate width of the peak at the TSS?

:question: What kinds of files were output by MACS2? What is the difference between the different formats?

:question: How many peaks are there for each sample? [hint: Remember the wc command...]

:question: How many peaks are there in the window: chr4:105,410,415-105,419,498? How many summits?

:question: How many peaks are in the merged peak files?

:question: What is the the most enriched known motif in the NK peaks? In the HSC peaks?
