## SETUP

First you will have to connect to the server we have set up for you:

	ssh <sunetID>@corn.stanford.edu
	# e.g. ssh zappala@corn.stanford.edu

Once connected, run:

	echo $SHELL

If the response is `tcsh`, run the following command:

	source /afs/ir/class/bios201/setup/setup_tcsh.sh 

If the response is `bash`, run the following command:

	source /afs/ir/class/bios201/setup/setup_bash.sh
